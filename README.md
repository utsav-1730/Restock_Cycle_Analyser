# ðŸ“¦ Walmart Logistics & Stockout Dashboard

This project visualizes and analyzes truck delivery delays and stockout behaviors across key Walmart departments using realistic, scenario-based mock data. Built with **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Streamlit**, this interactive dashboard provides a real-world simulation of how operations, delays, and inefficiencies manifest inside Walmart stores.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Understand how **delivery timing** impacts **shelf availability**
- Track **top delay reasons** affecting restocking workflows
- Identify **departments most prone to stockouts**
- Simulate **real-world decision-making** with data-backed insights

---

## ðŸ“Š Features

- Filter by **Department** and **Date Range**
- View:
  - **Delay Reason Frequency**
  - **Average Stocking Delay (minutes)**
  - **Stockouts by Department**
  - **Truck Volume per Day**
- KPI summaries and full interactive data table
- Built for use by:
  - Store operations managers
  - Transportation teams
  - Inventory analysts

## ðŸ§  Key Findings

| Metric                  | Insight                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Top Delay Reason        | `Late Truck` and `Staff Shortage` lead in delay causes                 |
| Most Affected Depts     | `Garden Centre`, `Produce`, and `Dairy` show recurring stockouts       |
| Avg Delay by Dept       | `Frozen`, `Grocery`, and `General Merchandise` show longest delays     |
| Daily Volume Trends     | Delivery surges occur mid-week (Tueâ€“Thu), matching stocking pressure   |

## ðŸ’¡ Operational Recommendations

1. **Late Truck Arrival**:
   - Improve supplier/truck dispatch coordination
   - Introduce real-time GPS alerting + predictive ETA tools

2. **Staff Shortage**:
   - Schedule peak-hour labor with delay forecasts
   - Cross-train unloaders and sales floor staff for dynamic handoffs

3. **Stockouts in Key Depts**:
   - Use ML to forecast high-demand SKUs (e.g., soil in Garden Centre)
   - Auto-alert replenishment if shelf lag > 2 hours from delivery

4. **Overall Logistics Optimization**:
   - Link truck data to CRM tools like Salesforce for unified visibility
   - Embed delay dashboards in store-level decision rooms
